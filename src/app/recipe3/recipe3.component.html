            <h2>HOW TO MAKE</h2>
    <p>1.A great vegetable fried rice recipe begins with well-cooked white rice. To do so, first, soak 1 cup of basmati rice (190 to 200 grams) in water for 30 mins. Then drain and set rice aside.</p>
    <p>2. In a large pot add 4 to 4.5 cups of water, ½ teaspoon salt, and 2 to 3 drops of toasted sesame oil (or any cooking oil), and set over high heat on the stovetop.</p>
    <p>3. Let the water reach a full boil.</p>
    <p>4. Now it’s time to stir-fry the vegetables. Start by heating 3 tablespoons of preferred cooking oil in a wok or a deep skillet. Add 1 whole star anise and fry for a few seconds, until the oil becomes fragrant.</p>
    <p>5.Taste the dish, and then add ½ a teaspoon of ground black pepper and as much salt as you like.</p>
    <p>6.You are now ready to put everything together to make the veg fried rice. To the wok or skillet of veggies add the cooked and cooled rice – 1 cup or so at a time.</p>
    <p>7.With the heat still on medium to medium-high, continue to gently mix and fry the vegetables with rice for a couple of minutes.</p>
    <p>8.Lastly, add more fresh chopped spring onions. You can either sprinkle on top as a garnish or mix into the fried rice to incorporate.</p>
